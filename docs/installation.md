## Development dependencies

```

## File /app/layout.tsx

### Parameters Doubts

**Can you explain to me the meaning of the arguments subexpression `{  children,}: {  children: React.ReactNode }` ?**

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

The parameter declaration in your `.tsx` program might look a bit confusing at first, but *it's actually a common pattern in TypeScript, especially in the context of React*. Let's break it down:

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  // Function body
}
```

In this function declaration, `RootLayout` is a React functional component. The part that might be confusing is the way `children` is being declared and typed. Here's what's happening:

1. **Destructuring children from Props**: The `{ children }` part is using JavaScript's object destructuring syntax. It means that the function expects an object as its argument, and it extracts the `children` property from that object. In React, `children` is a special `prop` that represents any child components or elements passed between the opening and closing tags of a component.
2. **Type Annotation for Props**: The `: { children: React.ReactNode }` part is a **TypeScript type annotation**. It specifies the expected shape of the `props` object that the `RootLayout` component will receive. In this case, it's saying that 
   - the `props` object should have a property named `children`, and 
   - the type of `children` should be `React.ReactNode`[^1]
  
[^1]: `React.ReactNode` is a TypeScript type provided by **React**, which encompasses anything that can be rendered in a React component (like strings, numbers, JSX, arrays of these types, etc.).

Putting it all together, this function declaration is saying: 

"The `RootLayout` component expects to receive `props` in the form of an object. This object must have a property named `children`, which can be *anything renderable in React*."

When you use `RootLayout` in your React app, you might do something like this:

```tsx
<RootLayout>
  <div>Hello, world!</div>
</RootLayout>
```

In this example, `<div>Hello, world!</div>` is passed as the `children` prop to `RootLayout`.

### Warnings from VSCode

Initially for the code:

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children, }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Got the following warnings:

```
'React' refers to a UMD global, but the current file is a module. 
Consider adding an import instead.
```

**GH Copilot explanation:**

The error message you're encountering suggests that 
- you're trying to use the 'React' library as a UMD (**Universal Module Definition**) *global*, 
- but the current file is a *module*. 

To resolve this issue, you should import the 'React' library instead of relying on it as a global variable.

In a TypeScript React project, you can `import` the 'React' library using the following syntax:

```ts
import React from 'react';
```

Once you've imported the '`React`' library, you can use it to create React components, hooks, and other features within your project.

Additionally, **ensure that you have the necessary TypeScript and React configurations set up in your project**. 

**This typically involves having a valid '`tsconfig.json`' file** with the appropriate settings for `React` and `TypeScript`.

**Thoughts**

I have to look into this. I am not sure so I look at at the `tsconfig.json` file for the version generated by `npm create-next-app@latest`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "incremental": true,
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "next"
      }
    ],
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", ".next/types/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

- Exercise: Ask GH Copilot about the meaning of the fields in the `tsconfig.json` file.

**Good to know** 

If you forget to create `layout.tsx`, Next.js will automatically create this file when running the development server with next dev.

## File app/pages.tsx

```tsx
import React from 'react'

export default function Page() {
    return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}
```

## The public folder (optional)

Create a `public` folder to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside public directory can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`)

```

The `next-env.d.ts` file is a TypeScript declaration file is typically generated automatically when you create a new Next.js project using the create-next-app command.
It is git ignored. It ensures that the TypeScript compiler recognizes and provides type checking for the Next.js framework and its specific features, such as the `Image` component.
